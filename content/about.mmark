### Biography
I'm a second year M.Sc. student of [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) in [Nanjing University](http://www.nju.edu.cn/). I received my B.Sc. degree in [School of Electronic Science and Engineering](http://ese.nju.edu.cn/) in June 2016 from Nanjing University. In the same year, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University without entrance examination. I was also a member of [Excellent Engineer Training Program](/img/about/engineer.jpg), from Ministry of Education of China.

  <summary><span style="color: #008AFF">Xinya: Chinese Lyrics Generation</span></summary><br>
  <img src="/img/about/xinya.png" width="400">
  A Chinese lyrics generation system based on generative adversarial network. Autoencoder is used to encode a lyric line into a latent code, and the generator tries to generate a "realistic" latent code based on the current context which will be decoded into a new lyric line. A n-gram language model helps to improve the generated result and control the length of the generated line. The autoencoder is pretrained optimizing the cross entropy and then the GAN is trained under the WGAN objective. The qualily and variation of generation is way better than previous maximum likelyhood methods (like seq2seq).

  <summary><span style="color: #008AFF">Intelligent Case Management System</span></summary><br>
  <img src="/img/about/12345.png" width="300">
  A intelligent case management system for the Government Hotline Service Center of Nanjing. It integrates GIS and NLP techniques into the ordinary case management system, which enables the telephone operators to quickly mark associated locations on the map, assign cases following case assignment recommendations and inform the governors of what people in this city are complaining about through visualizations of text clustering results and hard-to-deal-with cases by outlier analysis.

  <summary><span style="color: #008AFF">Graphic Design to 3D Printing</span> </summary><br>
  <img src="/img/about/3d.png" width="300">
  Convert 2D graphic designs to 3D-printable models. The demo above illustrates converting a SVG file to a STL model, by sampling vertices along Bezier paths, performing constrained Delaunay triangulation, and converting a 2d mesh to 3D. ([demo code](/about/svg2stl.py))

  <summary><span style="color: #008AFF">Virtual Fitting Room</span></summary><br>
  <img src="/img/about/virtual.jpg" width="300">
  A virtual fitting system based on Kinect and 3D human models. A picture of clothes with similar posture is queried using ANN-search, and further streched by a SCAPE 3D human model which is estimated from input RGBD frames.

- Nowadays when I'm not writing code or doing research, I usually hang out with friends or take a long walk alone. I enjoying being alone and connected both!
